                        <p>
                            I was part of the work where our research shows that tiny defects,specifically missing aluminum atoms,create new pathways in spodumene, drastically reducing the energy needed to move lithium ions. This discovery is key to developing more efficient and less energy-intensive methods for lithium extraction.

                            I was part of this research where we've developed a simple, one-step method to mass-produce powerful bimetallic catalysts by anchoring iron and nickel atoms onto activated carbon. Thanks to the synergy between the metals, these catalysts enabled a zinc-air battery to achieve a remarkable stability of over 1000 hours.

                        <p>
                            I was part of this research where we developed a low-cost electrolyte by adding urea to a water-based zinc-ion battery, which "locks up" free water molecules to suppress harmful side reactions. This simple approach significantly expands the battery's stable voltage window and enables long-lasting, high-performance energy storage.

                            I was part of this research where we developed PyAMFF, a user-friendly, Python-based package that uses an atom-centered neural network to construct fast and accurate machine-learning force fields. The package is highly efficient and scalable due to its integrated Fortran modules and is designed to interface with other simulation software like EON and ASE for advanced applications.

                            I was part of this research where sodiophilic micro-composite films of sodium-chalcogenides (Na‚ÇÇTe and Na‚ÇÇS) were fabricated on copper foam current collectors to guide sodium metal electrodeposition. This new substrate enables dendrite-free sodium growth and creates a stable solid-electrolyte interphase, leading to sodium metal batteries with state-of-the-art stability and high-rate performance.

                            I was part of this research where a stable anode-free all-solid-state battery was developed by modifying the copper current collector with a thin, lithiophilic layer of lithium telluride (Li‚ÇÇTe). This engineered surface promotes uniform, dendrite-free lithium metal deposition, which dramatically improves the battery's Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability compared to standard collectors.

                        <h3>Modulation of CO2 adsorption thermodynamics and selectivity in alkali-carbonate activated N-rich porous carbons</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was part of this research where we analyzed how the choice of activating alkali cations (lithium, sodium, or potassium) during synthesis impacts the properties of nitrogen-rich activated carbons. It demonstrates that the specific cation used significantly influences the material's nitrogen content, porosity, and surface area, which in turn allows for tuning its thermodynamic efficiency and selectivity for CO‚ÇÇ capture.
